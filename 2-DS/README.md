#### Throwing cards away I
>This question is simple and basic.You can solve this Problem in 2 ways(Using 2 type of DS)   
`1.`Using Vector : just remove first element or __Push_back( )__ to end of vector. do it continuously until size of vector is equal to __1__. see[`code`](https://github.com/mehranagh20/ACM-ICPC/blob/master/uva/throwing-cards-away-i/10935.cpp)    
`2.`Using queue .this is similar to vector.just __pop( )__ or __push( )__ continuously until __q.size( ) == 1__ . then you can print the out put.all of these operations do in a for loop .see [`code`](http://codealltheproblems.blogspot.com/2015/10/uva-10935-throwing-cards-away-i.html)

* the important part of this question is how to output.if you get wrong answer notice how you print your outputs and notice that n can be equal to __1__
